It ranges from "verbatim\n        copying" (e.g., cutting-and-pasting code) to "thorough\n        paraphrasing" (e.g., changing variable names or rearranging\n        code).'],partner:["The more lenient collaboration policy for this course\n        is a privilege; it is founded in the trust between\n        students and instructors.
