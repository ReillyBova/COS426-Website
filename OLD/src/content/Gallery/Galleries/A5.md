An unpinned cloth when the upward rain and shear constraint is and isn't applied, respectively. This makes it appear as if the cloth is floating and dancing in the air. The higher the rain strength or rate is, the higher up the cloth floats.

| My custom wind function is applied then removed to cause the cloth spin. The cloth is initially stretched then decreases in size until it returns to its relaxed state. | Same as the video above but with a clear background sharingan cloth pattern. | A custom cloth pattern applying rain when the rain function initially added the rainForce force instead of subtracting it. This caused the cloth to float upward when the cloth isn't pinned and the rain strength or rate is high. Lower rain strength or rate brings the cloth back down. |
