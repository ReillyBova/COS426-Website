For our project we plan on making a demo of the popular Portal games by Valve. Both of us have played through Portal 2 and we found the game mechanics and design to be really creative and interesting. Additionally, the main feature of the game, namely the portals, are interesting to implement and design from a technical standpoint. The demo we plan to create incorporates a lot of topics from this course, including rendering, matrix transformations, ray intersections, and collisions/physics, and builds upon the THREE.JS framework we have been using in assignments. The project has potential for a lot of depth, and there are many features beyond our MVP that we can consider to include. Overall, we're really excited about this project and hope to execute it well!
