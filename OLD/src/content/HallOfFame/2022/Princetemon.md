Princetémon is a Princeton-themed top-down role-playing video game (RPG). Inspired by the plot-driven and interactive nature of Pokémon, Princetémon consists of several scenes and mini-games that are navigated by an individual player, who is a student at Princeton University. In order to enter Frist Campus Center, which has been locked by Christopher Nolan’s filming crew, the student must complete mini-games to collect props necessary for entrance from various locations on campus, such as Poe Field (where they have to dodge construction debris) and The Street (where they have to learn a dance choreography). Currently, we plan to include 2 mini-games (each associated with a unique location) in our MVP, with stretch goals of ultimately having 3-4 mini-games and/or a final “boss level” at Frist Campus Center itself. Princetémon is characterized by a retro pixelated style. The characters and scenes will be created using Piskel, which allows for custom 16px by 16px tiling. The game mechanics will be built using Three.js and/or HTML5, which will allow for handling user input such as controlling the character’s movement with the arrow buttons (which will be useful for both navigating between different scenes and for completing the mini-games).
