        `Plagiarism and abetting plagiarism are serious academic
        infractions. Programming is a creative work and the academic
        regulations that apply to plagiarizing prose also apply to
        plagiarizing code. Princeton's `,
        `Rights, Rules, Responsibilities`,
        ` defines plagiarism as "the use of any outside source
        without proper acknowledgment." It ranges from "verbatim
        copying" (e.g., cutting-and-pasting code) to "thorough
        paraphrasing" (e.g., changing variable names or rearranging
        code).`,

        is a privilege; it is founded in the trust between

        having this policy revoked for the entire class.`,

        outside sources, they must cite any code that they copy
        or adapt (with the exception of code that is included
        in the assignment starter files).`,

        a course grade plus whatever penalty that the CoD imposes.
        (The typical CoD penalty for plagiarism is suspension
        from the University for one year.) Violators of course
        policies that are not adjudicated by the CoD will receive
        penalties based on the severity of the violation, ranging
        from a warning (for violations that are both unintentional
        and innocuous) to an F in the course (for violations that
        are both intentional and serious).`,
