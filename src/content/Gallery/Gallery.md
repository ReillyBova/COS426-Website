This art gallery contains a curated selection of student artwork from this semester. For each assignment, students are invited to submit a few results of their work for the assignment art contest. A jury of instructors then vote on all the submissions to determine the art contest winners. As a reward for their high quality work, art contest winners receive two points of assignment extra credit, and honorable mentions receive one and a half points of assignment extra credit. Students whose work was not selected for this art gallery will still receive a single point of assignment extra credit for participating.
