The goal of this project was to create a graphical representation of the solar system, including its planets, major moons, and other prominent objects like dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets. In this program, planets are accurately positioned in the simulation according to their orbital data, so the user can see an accurate spatial layout of the solar system. Celestial bodies are rendered with great visual accuracy, using available textures and carefully tuned reflection models. The user may move the view throughout the solar system, zoom in on different objects, and look around using mouse controls.
