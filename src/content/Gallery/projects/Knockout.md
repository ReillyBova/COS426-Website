3D Knockout is a 2-4 player game based off of the 2D Game Pigeon game “Knockout,” in which players launch their penguin characters with specified magnitude and direction in an effort to knock the opposing player’s penguin characters off of the ice sheet that the game is played on. A player begins with four penguin characters and wins by knocking all of the opponents’ penguins off the ice sheet while having at least one of their characters remaining in the end. Each player gets one opportunity to “launch” their penguins per round, and the penguins begin to move according to the user’s instructions simultaneously at the end of the round. In our project, we managed to implement all of the key aspects from the original 2D game into a visually appealing 3D scene containing the icy playing field, an animated ocean, mountains, and several dynamic, exotic creatures. However, we also implemented other cool features such as incorporating a scoreboard, sound effects, a rotatable camera angle, and the ability to play with 2-4 players.
