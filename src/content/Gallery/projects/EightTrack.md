8-Track Payback allows the player to visualize and interact with music they are hearing. Upon entering the game, the player can select the music to be played from a list. The player then controls an avatar through a tunnel-like scene, trying to dodge the 3D obstacles coming from all directions that are generated from the music being played. Getting hit by an obstacle costs the playerâ€™s lives. The player loses the game when all lives are lost, and wins when they survive a complete piece of music.
