This fall semester, Princeton University is offering a new class DRI 101: Driver’s Ed. Our game, Driver’s Ed, is an infinite-runner game in which a player controls a car driving down Washington Road. Each player is given three lives (or three chances in the class), and every time they hit an obstacle they lose a life. The player uses the arrow keys to dodge the obstacles— pedestrians, crossing animals, and other cars— all while trying to collect coins.

The goal of the game: get as many coins as possible without getting kicked out of the class. Driver’s Ed uses computer graphics concepts, such as polygonal meshes, light rendering, and collision modeling, to create an enjoyable and aesthetically-pleasing game for players.
