Gradual Gravity Gauntlet is an immersive platforming game with one singular goal: Fall onto the ground at a low enough velocity so that you can survive the fall! This threshold velocity and current velocity will always be displayed on the screen for the player’s convenience so they always know how they are doing. The game uses several aspects of physics such as gravity and collisions in order to simulate a real life skydive. Many realistic objects such as birds and clouds will be in the way in order to slow the diver’s fall, and several rings will be in the way to speed the diver up. The rings will cause a lot of stress, so please avoid those rings! Have fun diving and good luck!
