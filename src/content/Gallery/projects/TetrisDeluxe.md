This project is a 3D representation of Tetris, written using the Three.js library and Node.js. The game includes all the classic features of Tetris, along with several graphical enhancements and powerups. The graphical enhancments include changing the texture and shape of the blocks, as well as adding a neon effect using bloom postprocessing. The powerups can speed up or slow down the game, remove columns, or shuffle each row.
