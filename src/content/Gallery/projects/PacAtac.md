Pac-Atac is an exciting first person shooter game inspired by nostalgic Pac-Man aesthetics and first person shooter classics.  Players play as Pac-Man and attempt to survive for as many waves as possible by shooting cherries and other assorted fruits to defeat the unrelenting ghosts.

Developed using ThreeJS, Pac-Atac reconciles dynamic game-design and visually-exciting graphics concepts to promise an action-packed 2.5D experience in the spirit of Pac-Man.
