CoronaTime is an “endless runner” game in which the player is a white blood cell, moving through a blood vessel. Along the way, the player must kill as many viruses as possible by colliding with them, while avoiding getting stuck in blood clots, which kill the player. Collisions with small antibody objects provide power-ups: either a temporary reduction in speed or invincibility to blood clots. Building off the simple “endless runner” style, we achieved 3D motion for all our objects and implemented randomly generated bends in our blood vessels. Moreover, we utilize the post-processing Bloom effect to create exciting visuals and add audio to create an immersive gameplay experience that has relevance to the current global pandemic caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19).
