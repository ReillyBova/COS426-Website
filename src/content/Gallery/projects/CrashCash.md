Crash for Cash is a single player game that operates with a simple objective, navigate around a map using your arrow keys, trying to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding police cars that are scattered throughout the scene. Starting with a welcome screen and ending with a game over screen, the user is engaged throughout the whole process, entering the scene as a stationary sphere that can be moved in any direction by the arrow keys. The physics is semi-realistic with an arcade-like feel, making the movement challenging yet responsive, while the camera follows the player from a distance and keeps the controls simple and reliable. We managed to successfully make an addicting arcade game that allows users to try to beat their high score while providing an engaging and reliable graphic landscape with room for further improvements and feature additions.
