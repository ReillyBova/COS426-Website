PrinceTron Legacy is a 3D reimagining of the lightcycles game Tron Legacy.Two  players  use  the  same  screen  and  control  motorcycles  that  leave  colored trails  behind  them.   The  goal  of  the  game  is  to  survive  the  longest  without intersecting your own trail,  your opponentâ€™s trail,  or the borders of the game board.
