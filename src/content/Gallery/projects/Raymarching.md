We explore an alternative technique to raytracing for rendering 3D scenes
called signed distance field raymarching that represents the entire scene using
a signed distance field (SDF) that maps each point in space to the distance
to the nearest object. We are able to implement comparable features to the
raytracer in assignment 3 at near real-time frame rates (10-30 FPS). We also
render a scene that would be infeasible to produce with raytracing due to its
recursive nature. We highlight the composable nature of the SDF representation
by building an editor that allows users to build complex shapes by composing
primitives with transformations.
