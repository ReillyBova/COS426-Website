Type Type Revenge is a 3D web game built with Three.js to provide an interactive environment for users of various typing levels to practice their typing skills. In this game, random letters fall down the screen in time with music, and players must type the corresponding keyboard key as a letter reaches its target at the bottom of the screen. There are two song options and three levels of difficulty offered, and point values increase as the player reaches longer streaks of successfully typed letters.
