The goal of this project was to develop a flight simulator game, primarily using three.js libraries. The objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible before running out of fuel or crashing. The result is a simple simulation and control of an airplane’s key movement components: thrust, roll, yaw and pitch. Although there is more work required to achieve a realistic simulation that takes more aerodynamics into account, the current work can serve as a simple and clear illustration of how an airplane controls its movement. On a technical level, this project efficiently generates a non-repetitive, ‘infinite’ scene procedurally using randomness (Perlin noise for the terrain). The method used in this project to procedurally generate scenes to create an illusion of an infinite scene can easily be applied in other settings to achieve a similar effect. Lastly, the project demonstrates an ability to import external glTF files to render realistic objects and detect collisions between the camera (airplane) and objects in the scene.
