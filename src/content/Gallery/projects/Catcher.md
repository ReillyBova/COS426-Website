In this project, we create a game centered around catching falling objects from the  sky. Inspired by the current COVID-19 pandemic, the game’s player catches falling PPE  and vaccine components while avoiding falling virus particles. In this report we detail how  our game evolved from the starter code provided to the bare bones version presented as  an MVP and finally to the final product demonstrated in the live demo. The report also  details the multitude of features implemented by our game and the various obstacles that  we encountered in developing them. Throughout this process, we were successfully able  to create a game where the player receives points for catching falling  physically-simulated objects while avoiding physically-simulated virus particles.
