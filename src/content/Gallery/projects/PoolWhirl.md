Our group created an infinite single-player game called PoolWhirl. The playerâ€™s objective is to navigate a teddy bear on a tube within a whirlpool. The teddy bear must avoid obstacles floating on the water and collect as many points as possible; its motion can be controlled using the left and right arrow keys. Colliding with rubber ducks causes the bear to be knocked toward the center of the whirlpool and the player to lose points; ducks also become haloed and super-charged (more damaging) after lightning strikes. The player gains points by consuming fish. The game ends when the teddy bear is sucked into the center of the whirlpool.
