mpThree.js is a music-adapting retro racer that is powered by YOUR music. Users upload their own .mp3 files, and the game elements interact with the music to create a unique experience. Over the course of the song, players avoid red 'death spheres' and try to collect gems and power-ups to rack up as many points as they can.
