Hue Are You is a personality quiz with a colorful twist. You are on a journey to slay an evil monster, but on the way you must go through an even more challenging task: self discovery.  Please, do pause a moment and take in the luscious scenery. But beware, every choice you make impacts the color of your result. Dawn is approaching. What are you waiting for?

As you can see, we have created a quiz where the user travels around the scene and ultimately receives a color to represent their personality. We hope that people might enjoy the experience and explore the scene after.
