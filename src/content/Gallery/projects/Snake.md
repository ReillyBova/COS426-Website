For our final project, we decided to implement a 3D version of the classic Snake game in Three.js. In this version, you are a little red spherical snake in someone’s front yard. Eat the mice to get bigger, but don’t hit the fence! The game is played in first person for more ~intrigue~ and an extra challenge as well.
