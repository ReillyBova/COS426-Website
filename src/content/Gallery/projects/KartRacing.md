For our final project, we created a web-based, player-versus-player racing game with the ThreeJS library. We were inspired by the gameplay mechanics and design of Nintendo’s Mario Kart franchise as well as the split-screen multiplayer gameplay and style of COS 426 Spring 2019’s ColoRing. As such, we implemented two-player keyboard controls, split-screen functionality, driving mechanics, collision physics, a basic track, moving obstacles, consumable power-ups, a lap counter, as well as start and end menus. We applied a colorful design inspired by the famous Rainbow Road from the Mario Kart series.
