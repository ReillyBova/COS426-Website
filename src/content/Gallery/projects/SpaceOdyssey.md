Princeton 2020: A Space Odyssey is a space flight game where the player must navigate an ongoing asteroid field while also collecting enough fuel to survive. Players can hope to join an exciting, flight-centered space adventure. Pilot a spaceship flying through outer space as you attempt to warp home by collecting fuel charges. The primary objective will be achieved by the player collecting fuel charges as they spawn while avoiding flying asteroids or picking up powerups to become invulnerable to asteroid collisions.
