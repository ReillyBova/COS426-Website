Inspired by the incredibly popular game Tetris, we want to bring it to three-dimensions using Three.JS. The playing field will be a rectangular prism, and some of the familiar block shapes from Tetris will be joined by a few new 3D-friendly blocks with control to rotate them on all three axes and swing the camera around the field to get a better look at the game state. Some reach goals include other gamemodes, such as having a non-rectangular base or survival for a set line amount.
