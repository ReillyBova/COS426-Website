We created an infinite runner game where the player is an ice cube traveling along volcanic ash platforms in order to evade the sea of lava beneath. The ice and fire themed game is entitled A Game of Ice and Fire‚Äù --- a spin off of George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy novel series *A Song of Ice and Fire*. In the game, the player has the ability to move forward, backward, left, right, and jump; the goal of the game, like any infinite runner game, is to make as much forward progress as possible.

The game design includes randomly placed volcanic ash platforms, rotating iceberg obstacles, ice trampolines, and storms of giant hail. As the player advances, both the aesthetics and difficulty of the game develop. BablylonJS and CannonJS were utilized to create a game that balanced user interface simplicity, game complexity, visual aesthetics, and smooth graphical rendering.
