The Modular Video Synthesizer is a virtual instrument for interactive video synthesis, drawing its aesthetic and design philosophy from the Eurorack format for audio synthesis. The instrument consists of 12 panels, made up of 5 different panel types, that users can control and wire together to generate rich and dynamic video in real time. Just like their physical counterparts, no two modules are linked together by default; the path that data takes from input to output is entirely set by the u ser.
