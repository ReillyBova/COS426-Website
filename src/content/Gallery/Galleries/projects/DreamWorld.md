This project entails the creation of a Javascript-based world simulation for focused meditation. We hypothesized that we could facilitate the meditation process by designing a dream-like world in which users can customize their own calming terrain through the perspective of a flying bird while listening to peaceful music and guided meditations.

With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting more people each day, we wanted to explore ways to remain calm and reduce stress through meditation. We were successful in our goal of creating this simulation, and in particular achieved our target results: the implementation of infinite terrain generation, realistic bird movement, and music and terrain (i.e. audiovisual) coordination.
