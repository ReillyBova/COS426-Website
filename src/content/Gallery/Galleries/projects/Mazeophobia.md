We’re building a simple horror game inspired by Phasmophobia, MacMan and Amnesia. It will be a 1st person game set in a randomly generated maze using mouse and WASD controls. The artistic focus will be on the horror ambiance. For stretch goals, we hope to include horrifying enemies, a type of marker the player can use to avoid getting lost, and variable luminance based on player “health.”
