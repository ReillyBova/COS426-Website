My project is a Rubikâ€™s Cube that can be controlled using both key inputs and the mouse. The cubes can be scrambled and solved. There are buttons to undo a move and reset the cube back to the original state. There are 4 options for the speed of turning the cube (slow, normal, fast, and very fast). There are 4 options for the size of the cube (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5). There is a button that shows and explains the controls for the cube.Each color of the cube can be changed independently and the colors can be reset to the default colors. There is a PLL/OLL trainer, the algorithms that solve the last layer. The trainer shows the algorithms and how they are done. It can be used to learn and to practice. Lastly, there is an example solve, which shows the 4 steps in the CFOP method.
