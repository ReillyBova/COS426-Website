PrinceTron Legacy is a 3D reimagining of the lightcycles-based game *Tron Legacy*. Two players use the same screen and control motorcycles that leave colored trails behind them. The goal of the game is to survive the longest without intersecting your own trail, your opponentâ€™s trail, or the borders of the game board.
