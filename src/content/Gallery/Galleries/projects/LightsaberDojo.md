We plan to create a first person melee combat game with a Star Wars theme. Players wield a lightsaber and are able to move around and turn in the environment via keyboard and mouse controls. Players can swing the lightsaber to attack enemies. The complexity of enemies will depend on the amount of time available to work on the project. At a minimum, a floating training droid equipped with blasters that fires at the player will be implemented, and the player can return the laser fire by hitting the bolts with their lightsaber. If timed correctly, the bolt may hit the droid and destroy it. Players can also evade bolts by moving around the environment. Players could be scored by the amount of time it takes to defeat one or more of these droids.
