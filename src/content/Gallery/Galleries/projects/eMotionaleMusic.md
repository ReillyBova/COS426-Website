Our project, e-Motional e-Music, brings together graphics and music into an interactive musical simulation. Inspired by our interest in collaborative music and marble-based musical contraptions, we decided to create the simulation using pianos and marbles. When a marble or other object interacts with the simulated piano keys, they will create sounds that the user can enjoy. The user will be able to interact with the piano through setting piano sounds and settings as well as through creating their own marbles and beautiful melodies. Long term goals of the project includes adding other musical instruments, refining the simulation to be more realistic, and allowing the user to potentially use the simulation to create their own music with a looping or editor system.
