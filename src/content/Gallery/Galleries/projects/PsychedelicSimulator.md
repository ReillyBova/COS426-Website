Our project aims to create a psychedelic-like experience for our users. Essentially, we want to build something really interesting looking. Using THREE.js, we intend to generate fractals and animate their motion. We want to capture the attention of our users and inspire them to think creatively. Working at the intersection of computer science and the natural art of fractal patterns, we hope to inspire others to think of their CS skills as not just applicable to tech but as creative tools across all fields.
