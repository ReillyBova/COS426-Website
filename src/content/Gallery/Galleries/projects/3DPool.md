3D Pool is a two-player pool game where users can customize the pool table by choosing from a set of different themes. The game allows for both a 2D top-down view of the table as well as a 3D view in which the player can move around the table when it's their turn. The users can then play against one another in turn by setting angle of the cue and strength of the shot using keyboard controls.
