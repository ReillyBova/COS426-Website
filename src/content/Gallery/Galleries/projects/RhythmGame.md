We will be creating a rhythm game. Music will play, and in time with the music, various shapes will fall towards stationary locations. The primary objective will be for the user to appropriately time key presses to the beat of the music, earning a higher score the more accurate they are. The project will use Three.JS for the graphical component, using what we have learned so far in the course.
