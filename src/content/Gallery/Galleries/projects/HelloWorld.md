"Hello, World!" is an exploration of nature. In this game, we will have an avatar navigate an 3D world using the arrow keys to move around. The goal is to collect a series of pictures of target animals and plants in the world. These targets will be generated randomly and placed in random locations in the world. You collect pictures by going near the animal or plant and pressing "c".
