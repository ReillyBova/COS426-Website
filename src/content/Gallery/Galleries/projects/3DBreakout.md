This is single-player game based on the already existing Atari Breakout. The player controls a moving platform to prevent a ball from falling to the ground. At the same time, the player must attempt to break bricks with the ball. The gameplay will be 2D, but we will be implementing the bricks, platform, and ball with 3D visual effects.
