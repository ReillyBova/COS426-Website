Our project, entitled Red Green Bullets (RGB), was our attempt to create a simple but fun game based on the common genre of video games known as "bullet hells". In a bullet hell game, the player is normally given the ability to fire some sort of projectile, or bullet, and then tasked with killing numerous enemies and bosses. The enemies also have the ability to fire projectiles, and usually they are able to fire so many that dodging them becomes a real challenge. RGB is our take on this genre, given the allotted time.
