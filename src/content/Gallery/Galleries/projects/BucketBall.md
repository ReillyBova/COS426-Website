Bucket Ball is a mini golf game with interactive levels. To start the game, users will use their keyboard to aim the ball and then hold the space bar to select the power. Within its trajectory, the ball will have to face a wide array of obstacles that the user must maneuver around to get the ball successfully into the hole.

The user will aim to get the golf ball into the hole in the fewest amount of turns, before finally being presented a screen that displays the user's current score.
