# Contest Winners

### 1, Anthony Gartner (amg6)

My art contest submission is effectively a fluid simulation of a ripple in water according to a dampened wave function. It is done symmetrically along each axis to not only look more interesting, but to also better show the extent of the ripple.
If this program had a function for creating animations, this could be a functional animation of a ripple.
To create this, the large cube was first upscaled so that my wacky filter could apply to the cube without the ripple touching the edges of a face, and then the wacky function is applied.
The wacky function applies an offset according to a dampened wave function A\*e^(-bt) \* cos(w \* t + theta) where A, b, and theta have all been chosen arbitrarily, w = factor \* 10, and t = the distance of a vector from the axis the ripple is being created around.
If an animation were possible, t would stand for the time step in the animation, w would be scaled by the factor, and theta would be scaled by the distance from the axis, but without t, as it stands, ripple motion can be simulated by t = dist and decreasing w to simulate the flow of time.

### 2, Isabel Zaller (izaller)

I made the octopus colorful, applied my wacky method, twisted a bit, rotated, and inflated the octopus. To make the gif, I screen recorded as I changed the wacky parameter from the minimum to the max and back.

### 3, Caio Costa (ccosta)

For my art contest entry, I attempted to make a crystallization filter built off of the extrude and truncate filters. The first step is simply extruding the selected faces. Then, on each new face, I select a point on the face by summing randomly weighted fan-out vectors from one vertex on the face to each other vertex on the face. I add a new vertex at that point, and split the face between the new vertex and each of the original vertices on the face before moving the center vertex up by an amount in the interval [1 + crysallinity, 2 + crystallinity], where crystallinity is an input variable (basically how high to make the peaks). Once the center vertex is added, I move the face vertices in the direction of the face normal by an increasing amount starting at a pair of vertices and working around in pairs, in order to get a slanted face for the crystal. I also have some random jitter in the magnitude of the offsets. The last step is trunating the mesh. I also wanted to colorize each crystal, so I experimented with a few different schemes. The first was based on the position of the center vertex, the second was totally random colors, and the last was choosing a random number and using the same number for each channel. This also required modifying my truncate helper to optionally propagate the color of the old vertices when creating the new vertices.

### 3, Charles Liu (cl43)

My art contest submissions are both made using wacky. The first one is simply sphere-2res translated, then with wacky. The translation is necessary because otherwise the vertices are all (almost) directly along their normals from the origin, making wacky have a minimal effect. However, by translating the sphere, all vertices except the ones along the translation vector no longer have zero components orthogonal to their normals, allowing for the sphere to have a symmetrical wavy effect. Because sphere-2res doesn't have that many vertices, wacky's wavy effect is somewhat spiky, and the outcome resembles a two-sided flower. The gif of the cube illustrates how factor being present both inside and outside the sine function allows for the waves to simultaneously become more frequent and steeper.

### 3, Edward Yang (efyang)

First image: result of 4 extrudes on a dodecahedron and a little smoothing results along with the random vertex colors gives rise to a very exotic looking meteorite.
Second Image: A wacky octopus smoothed out with loop subdivision and then scaled and with a modified coloring curvature operation gives rise to a pretty nightmarish creature.
Third Image: A wacky armadillo scaled up and with modified curvature applied gives a towering, almost bloodied figure of bad dreams.

### 3, Sten Sjoberg (ssjoberg)

I have a small gallery of submissions gathered at all stages of this project. The first is a series of 3 pictures where I made a primitive model of a duck (inspired by the duck-like figure created by extruding from a dodecahedron). After making the initial model, I attempted to make it more life-like using different filters, resulting in some pretty terrifying models. The second submission are the cartoon-looking characters created by my wonky version of inflate, where the inflation is exponentially proportional to the distance of a given vertex from origin. This results in accentuation of features farther from the origin and Crash Bandicoot-esque models. The fourth picture is just the big cube given the same treatment, and illustrates how the transformation looks.

### 3, Yael Stochel (ystochel)

Using a combination of several layers of quad topology and extrude, I made the Empire State Building. I included a pyschedelic version too!

### 4, AnneMarie Caballero (agc2)

My art project resulted from my favorite "bug," or intermediate step, in the project. While working on loop subdivision, I briefly commented out the weighting with 1/8 of the outer vertices used for calculating the positions of odd vertices. In doing so, I got a result, which makes the faces turn "spiky." I really liked this effect, so I tried it out on a lot of different meshes. I also added the color to see how it would turn out. In my opinion, for lower levels of subdivisions the shape without color looks better because it showcases the different protusions better, but, with more subdivisions, I prefer the more colorful option. I've attached a couple of different meshes, and numbers of subdivisions. I really liked seeing the progression of the dodecahedron, so I included all of the subdivisions for that.

### 4, Bates Brodie (bbrodie)

I started with the basic cube, before splitting it twice with quad topology. Then, I manually select alternative faces on the sides of the cube and top, then extruding them half way. Finally, I truncate all the edges.

### Al Liang (amliang)

This submission was created using the Wacky filter on amount 0.58 on the horse model. I thought it really enjoyably extended and flattened the horse's head and neck in a really interesting way.

### Jorge Zreik (jzreik)

For my art submission, I took the cube mesh and performed a series of extrudes and bevels until I got a shape that I thought looked interesting. It's very abstract, but looking at it now it reminds me of the Pokemon Cloyster or Koffing.

### Raiden Evans (rbevans)

I found a pretty cool pattern and organic-looking subdivision when writing loop subdivision. The object is a cube that has been incorrectly loop subdivided on two faces with an interesting pattern of selections. Another glitch happened when implementing this function, leading to a cow's forehead becoming not-so-smooth.
