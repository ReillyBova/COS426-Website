# Contest Winners

### 1, Benjamin Huang (bdhuang)

For this art, I modified extrude slightly to achieve a "spiraling" effect. Afterwards, I processed with loop subdivision and various other filters to produce some interesting volumes!

### 1, Elizabeth Petrov (epetrov)

I called catmull-clark and extrude multiple times to produce a cool fractal effect! Reminds me of a 3D snowflake.

### 1, Jason Kim (jjk7)

My Wacky  essentially swirls the mesh around all three axes. I realized that when this effect is applied to the octopus mesh, it makes the octopus look like it is floating in water and moving its tentacles. I decided to color the octopus using my curvature filter in addition to my loop subdivision filter to give the octopus a more natural appearance. Then, I varied the factor on my wacky filter from `0` to `0.15` to create an animation of the octopus moving.

### 1, Yunzi Shi (yunzis)

For my first submission, I applied noise and an adapted version of extrude to a sphere so the growth from the original surface is more random and organic. I changed the lightness of the vertices according to their distance from the original mesh surface. The result shows some kind of pulse, and a metaphor of the cycles of growth and decay.

### 2, Gabriel Roth (gjroth)

Behold my "Spiky Filter", which adds a new vertex on the centroid of every face (similar to quad subdivision) and translates it by a certain factor in the direction of the face's normal vector. The larger the factor, the more spiky the effect!

### 3, David Todd (dtodd)

To make these works, I first iteratively truncated all convex vertices. To make things a bit more interesting, I also introduced new vertices between truncations by finding the centroid of each face, connecting each vertex in the face to the centroid, then moving the centroid in the direction of the face normal. This led to a spiky appearance and allowed for more truncations. Finally, I colored the vertices such that the hue and saturation were proportional to the average area of adjacent faces.

### 3, Henry Wang (htwang)

Chester the Cheetah decided to try those "rainbow" colored Cheetos. Only, they weren't actually Cheetos. Now he's become the table that he was just eating those "Cheetos" on.

### 3, Heidi Kim (hyunsunk)

While creating my quad topology filter, I tried toying around with the displacement vector for the center point, which gave me interesting results. My first image shows how I imagine corona on a cellular scale. The other two are the results of applying my filter to `cube.png` and `octopus.png`.

### 3, Jake Kirkham (jak4)

I aimed to create a desktop wallpaper. I did this by extruding the biresolution sphere, finding a nice location, zooming deep inside, and taking a screenshot. Finally, I passed my image through greyscale and contrast filters in post production. Ideally, I would continue to color edit my artwork in order to make the gray closer to white and make the black pop, but I am busy trying to not get quarantined or die. Hope you are also doing well, reader!

### 3, Jamie Guo (jamieguo)

Here's an animation of my wacky filter on the biresolution sphere, ranging from `factor = 1` to ` factor = EPS` (almost zero)! I like how it looks squishy in the beginning!

# Honorable Mentions

### Christine Lu (cyclu)

To create my submission for the art contest, I first applied vertex colors and the wacky filter with amount `0.8` to the cheetah. Then, I inflated the cheetah with a factor of `0.65` and finally applied curvature-flow smoothing with `300` iterations and `delta = 0.01`.

### Donovan Coronado (dtc2)

When I was trying to implement wacky, I messed something up and just ended up flattening the object much. In retrospect, it was a happy accident because I think the result is pretty cool!

### Jonah Lytle (jlytle)

My first artwork is a play on the triangle topology function. I changed up the way the triangles were split into smaller triangles and thought it resulted in a cool flower-esque image when the half-edges are shown. My next artwork came from playing around with the smooth functions. Finally, when implementing the scale-dependent smoothing, I made a mistake with the scaling and the cheetah turned into a pup-looking version of itself!

### Nicholas Liu (nl3)

A serpentine Chinese dragon rises into the air! I created this artwork by first slightly smoothing a cheetah, applying some reverse inflation to make it thin and sleek, and finally a sin-based wacky filter to transform it into a dragon. Displaying half-edges creates the scales.

### Sophie Kader (skader)

For my art contest I decided to mimic the flowy-hair days of Justin Bieber. I accomplished this by conducting a loop subdivision three times on a cube, then extruding these new faces, truncating them, and finally twisting them.

### Taylor Beckett (tbeckett)

My art contest uses a filter similar to twist, except instead of just multiplying the `y` value of the vertex by the given factor, I multiplied the `x`, `y`, and `z` values by the given factor. This introduced some weird and interesting "twisted-plus" looks, and then of course I wanted to add some color.

### William Li (wl14)

To create this artwork, I took the default cube, truncated it, and extruded the faces created during the truncation step. For polish, I added a little bit of noise and enable vertex colors.
