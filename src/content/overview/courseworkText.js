        assignments (60%), one written exam (15%), a final
        programming project (20%), and course participation (5%).
        Throughout the semester, there will ample opportunities
        for extra credit and student participation. In
        particular, students are highly encouraged both to
        enter each assignment art contest, as well as to
        engage regularly with their peers on Piazza.`,

    exam: [
        `Only one exam is administered during this course.
        Currently, this exam is scheduled to be taken in-class
        on Thursday, 14 March 2019 (Midterms Week). The exam
        is closed-book however, students are permitted to
        each bring an `,
        ` 8.5x11" double-sided cheat-sheet.`,
        ` The written exam covers all course material up through
        (and including) week 5. Students may be tested on any
        and all graphics concepts touched on through lectures,
        readings, and assignments during this period. Examples
        of exams from previous offerings of this course will
        be posted soon; however, note that past exams may
        have covered different material.`,
        `Although the six weeks of course material that follow
        the exam are not covered on any written test, it
        is still "tested" through strict no-collaboration
        questions that are introduced into assignment writeups
        following Spring break. Effectively, these questions
        will serve as a second "take-home" exam spread
        throughout the later assignments. This is done in order
        alleviate  the dependency of students' final grades
        on their sole written exam grade, while also testing
        material without overburdening students with tedious
        and stressful examinations. Note that the grades for
        no-collaboration questions are incorporated into
        assignment grades rather than into exam grades.`,

    assignments: [
        `There are six biweekly programming assignments.
        Assignments are `,
        `not`,
        ` weighted evenly. Assignments will be implemented
        mostly in JavaScript. Any computer and browser may
        be used for development, however students should ensure
        that their programs work on Chrome with the latest
        release of macOS, as this is the environment
        in which submissions are tested and graded.`,
        `Assignments are submitted via the Princeton CS
        Dropbox. Students should look for the submission
        link in the description of each assignment, login
        with their Princeton netID, and then submit all applicable
        files by the posted deadline. Students may resubmit
        and unsubmit files as needed up until the submission
        deadline. Further alterations will result in the
        assignment being marked as late.`,
        `When submitting an assignment, all code, writeup,
        input images, output images, overlay images, etc.,
        should be packed into a single folder titled
        "assignmentN" (where N is the assignment number â€” eg.
        , assignment0) and compressed. In the interest of
        preserving space, it is requested that all images
        are submitted in .jpg format.`,
    ],
    final_project: [
        `The final project is a chance for students to
        build a system incorporating one or more idea
        that has been learned in class. Projects should
        be done in groups of two or three (other team
        sizes are permitted with permission of an
        instructor). The focus of the project can be
        anything of the group's choosing, as long as it
        somehow involves computer graphics. Many students
        choose to create games, or art demos, but it
        really can be anything.`,
        `Students are welcome to recycle code infrastructure
        provided for previous assignments, and they
        are also permitted to borrow ideas or other
        code infrastructure from the web or elsewhere.
        However, teams should be very careful to
        distinguish which parts they contributed to
        directly, and which other parts are loaned from
        elsewhere. Moreover, while it is ok to use
        common libraries/infrastructure, they should
        not dwarf students' own code in terms of their
        role in the project. In particular, if a
        hypothetical group were to make a game, they
        should not build on top of a highly polished
        and complete game engine like Unity.`,
    ],
    late: [
        `Assignments are due at 11:55PM on their posted
        due dates, where submission time is determined
        by the file date of the file upload. Following a
        very brief grace period (which students should
        confirm with an instructor beforehand), one minute
        late is the same as one day late. Note that if
        any part of an assignment is submitted late, the
        entire assignment will be marked late. To submit
        an assignment late, remove all uploads from the
        online submission system, since instructors will
        grade partial submissions as-is (whereas no submissions
        are marked late). Note that work cannot be accepted
        after Dean's Date without a Dean's recommendation.`,
        `Late assignments are marked down 1/4 of the
        full grade `,
        `per day or partial day`,
        ` late. The penalties for a student's first
        three late days are automatically waived.
        Additional late penalties will be waived only in
        the case of unforeseeable circumstances like
        medical emergencies, as documented by a student's
        Dean or Director of Studies. Note that late days
        cannot be used for the final project as it is due
        on Dean's Date`,
