        `Computer graphics is the intersection of computer
        science, geometry, physics, and art. This course will
        study topics in this broad and remarkable field, with an
        emphasis on practical methods and applications. In
        particular, the course will provide an extensive
        introduction to image processing, modeling, rendering,
        and computer animation. The goal of this course is to
        equip students with the various tools and techniques
        they need to build large projects with significant
        graphical components; this includes applications for
        realizing artistic visions (art and architecture), user
        interaction (UI/UX development), entertainment products
        (video games, CGI, animations, and augmented reality),
        visualizations and academic research (physics, biology,
        chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines), etc.`,
        `Topics include: color theory, sampling, image
        processing, image compositing, mesh representations,
        mesh processing, parametric curves and surfaces,
        implicit surfaces, subdivision surfaces, geometric data
        structures, geometric transformations, ray casting,
        lighting and reflectance, global illumination,
        rasterization, scan conversion, particle systems,
        animation, computer games, fabrication, etc.`,
    ],
    prereqs: [
        `The course is appropriate for students who have taken
        COS 217 and COS 226 (or equivalent). JavaScript will be
        the main programming language; however no prior
        knowledge of the language is required for students who
        wish to enroll in this course.`,

    lectures: [
        `Lectures are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
        3:00–4:20PM in Friend Center 006.`,
    ],
    precepts: [
        `Precept is held on Wednesday or Thursday from
        7:30–8:20PM in Friend Center 004. Students may attend
        either (or both) during any week, regardless of their
        registration. In general, precept attendance is highly
        encouraged.`,
    ],
    textbook: [
        `There is one "required" textbook for this course:`,
        `In the past, most students have found it is possible to
        pass the course without opening the textbook once, as
        almost all graded material is provided through lecture
        and precepts; nevertheless, this textbook will prove
        extremely useful for especially eager and motivated
        students who wish to pursue further studies in computer
        graphics. In addition to covering graphics concepts that
        could not otherwise squeeze into this course, the
        textbook contains wonderful C++ and OpenGL
        implementations that all graphics programmers would be
        well-suited to know.`,
