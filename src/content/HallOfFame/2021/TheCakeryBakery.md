The Cakery Bakery is a fun and interactive cake-making game where players rush against time to complete cake orders. The interface consists of plates passing by on a conveyor belt, and the player will have to press the correct keys to add the correct cake flavor, frost the cake and add various toppings according to the current customer's order. There will only be a limited time before the cake passes by, so the player must be quick, and the conveyor belt will speed up as the game progresses in difficulty. In terms of score, the player collects points for every correct order. The player also has a total of three lives, which will be lost if an incorrect cake is made or an order is missed. Visually, the game will have a retro 8-bit pixelated style.
