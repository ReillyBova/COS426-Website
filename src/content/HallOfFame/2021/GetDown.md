We plan to make a platform jumping game where the user must continue to jump down a series of rising platforms to avoid being crushed by the ceiling. Additionally, the player will have a health bar and may incur health damage from high falls, and too many hard hits could be game over as well. The goal of the game is to make it as far down the platforms as possible before dying. We plan to implement the game from a 3D first person perspective, and we hope to include multiple types of platforms, such as some with spikes, some with extra health points, some which flicker between being usable and unusable, some which might break when hit too hard, etc. to add an additional challenge level.
