We visualize the social construction of parallel honeycomb structures by thousands of simulated bees. This is modelled by two simultaneous processes; first, parallel combs are situated in a process modelled by BeliÄ‡ et al. involving random wax deposits and subsequent waxer bee interaction. Second, in a process still not fully understood, bees construct a pattern of aligned hexagonal cellsâ€”an ongoing debate asks whether bees build in a hexagonal pattern to begin with or if the hexagonal lattice arises as regularly-spaced cylindrical cells squeezed together. Either way, individual bees follow simple rules but construct complex hive structures as a cooperative group. We utilize Three.js to visualize the three dimensional honeycomb structure. The construction process is simulated over time and incorporates randomness from initial wax depositing to continuous bee movement. The user influences the construction process by choosing different input parameters, including the number of bees and bee behavior patterns such as competition between worker groups, wax attraction, and tendency to change orientation. We will also consider allowing the user to modify environmental factors such as the shape of the object on which the bees build and availability of food.
