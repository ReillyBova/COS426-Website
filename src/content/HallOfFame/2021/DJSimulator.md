You are DJ Felix, an aspiring local DJ, performing at Princeton's hottest new night club (Frist Litness Center). It's your job to get the crowd in front of you energized before your set is over. When prompted, you must interact with various components of the DJ table (which will light up and specify an action). The crowd in front of you will be partying to your music, but their reactions will depend on how well you complete your tasks. So: shift your dials, spin your turntables, and - whatever you do - don't forget to drop the bass!
