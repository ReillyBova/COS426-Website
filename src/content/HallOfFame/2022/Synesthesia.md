For my project, I'm hoping to be able to take in audio input as an mp3/mp4/etc. file and process features of the audio as parameters for an audio visualizer. Most audio visualizers that I've seen tend to only show what is happening in a song at the current moment but I'm hoping to have an audio visualizer that creates sort of an art piece that represents the song as a whole. My vision is to have a sort of blank canvas as the initial starting point of the song and as the song progresses, a drawing representing the song is created. This drawing would be made by some sort of trail that changes depending on parameters of the song.
