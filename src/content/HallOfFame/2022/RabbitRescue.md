You are a rabbit, jumping from tile to tile across a terrain seeking to rescue your baby rabbits before heading back to your burrow. Thereâ€™s a catch â€“ It is not so straightforward: there are hunters shooting bow and arrows at you as well as bear traps that you must avoid. Ryan and I will be writing in css/javascript for most of our implementation, and using pre-existing open source FBX files for the 3D objects that we will animate and render using THREEJS packages. For starters, we hope to implement the basics of the core gameplay including amongst others the rabbitâ€™s movement and procedurally generated terrain. If all goes well, we hope to further expand with berry potions that give HP and animations for both bow and arrows and baby rabbits that follow behind you as you collect them.
