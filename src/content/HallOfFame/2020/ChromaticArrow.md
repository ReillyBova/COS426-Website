Chromatic Arrow is an archery-based web game developed using the ThreeJS library. Its core gameplay consists of shooting arrows at targets that randomly spawn in 360 degrees around the player. Arrows follow the laws of physics, so the player must account for gravity and wind while aiming. There are also invisible barriers throughout the scene that will block the player‚Äôs shots; barriers are revealed by paint splatters whenever an arrow collides with them.

The more the player shoots, the more of the level is uncovered. Points are scored by hitting targets and revealing barriers before time runs out.
